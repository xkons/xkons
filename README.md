### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work as a software engineer at [LeanIX](https://github.com/leanix) maintaining a large enterprise Angular application. I like to foster autonomous teams (e.g. through microfrontends), design systems and reasonable testing.

Apart from that I'm also the volunteer tech lead at [German Angel](https://german-angel.de/), a non-profit organization that provides free tutoring and german classes in elementary schools. Especially to families who otherwise couldn't afford it.

I maintain a personal blog over at [xkons.de](https://www.xkons.de) where I occasionally write about how to teach programming to teens and generally try to share knowledge.
